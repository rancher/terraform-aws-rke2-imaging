# this has a lifecycle that is isolated because we want to be able to create and destroy it every time we run the CI
# this allows a very short lifecycle for infrastructure that allows CI access to prototype (never servers)
# since the lifecycle is short, and the access is limited to an ephemeral CI, and we use the same measures we would for any user (ssh keys, not sharing with others, etc)
#  we can feel relatively comfortable allowing the CI to configure the prototype servers (not the production servers)
#  we wipe the prototype and project clean of this access when it is done being configured so that production servers can be isolated
